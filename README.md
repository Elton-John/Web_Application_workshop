# Web_Application_workshop
:boom: The workshop in the form of performing one large task, which is the preparation of one larger program based on: 

   **JSP, MVC, Servlets, OOP, MySQL, DAO classes, Maven, Bootstrap**.
   
   And allows faster and more reliable navigation in **Java code** and **IntelliJ program**

:green_heart: You can:

* :star2: **create**, 
* :star2: **modify** and 
* :star2: **delete** users 
by saving to the database.

You also have the option to **view a list** of all users, and single user details.

:green_heart: In this project i used **SB Admin 2**, which is a free, open source, Bootstrap 4 based admin theme  for creating dashboards and web applications. 
  
:green_heart: The UserDAO class should offer the ability to:

- **create** - saves the object to the table as a new row;
- **read** - reads one row from the table and returns the object that represents this row;
 - **update** - saves the object to the table by modifying an existing table row;
 - **delete** - deletes an object from the table, that means removes a row with the same id as saved in the object;
 - **findAll** - reads all rows from the table, based on each a row creates a new object,
then returns a list with all created objects


 Very very satisfying for me at the beginning of my Java learning :blush:
